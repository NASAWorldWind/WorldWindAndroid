 * Surface of a planet or celestial object.

 * <h3>Caching Terrain Queries</h3>
 * <p>
 * Terrain implementations typically model a subset of the globe's surface at varying
 * resolution. In this case results from the methods {@code intersect} and {@code surfacePoint} cannot be cached. Either
 * method may fail to compute a result when the terrain surface has no geometry in the region queried, and even if
 * computation is successful the result is based on an unknown resolution. However, if the terrain implementation is
 * known to model a pre-determined resolution and region of interest results from the methods {@code intersect} and
 * {@code surfacePoint} may be cached.
