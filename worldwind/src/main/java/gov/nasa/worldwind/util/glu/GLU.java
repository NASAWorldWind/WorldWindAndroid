   * <UL>
   * <LI><b>GLU_TESS_WINDING_RULE</b>
   *   <BR>
   *   Determines which parts of the polygon are on the "interior".
   *   <em>value</em> may be set to one of
   *   <BR><b>GLU_TESS_WINDING_ODD</b>,
   *   <BR><b>GLU_TESS_WINDING_NONZERO</b>,

   *   <BR><b>GLU_TESS_WINDING_ABS_GEQ_TWO</b>.
   *   <BR>
   *   To understand how the winding rule works, consider that the input
   *   contours partition the plane into regions.  The winding rule determines
   *   which of these regions are inside the polygon.
   *   <BR>
   *   For a single contour C, the winding number of a point x is simply the
   *   signed number of revolutions we make around x as we travel once around C
   *   (where CCW is positive).  When there are several contours, the individual
   *   winding numbers are summed.  This procedure associates a signed integer
   *   value with each point x in the plane.  Note that the winding number is
   *   the same for all points in a single region.
   *   <BR>
   *   The winding rule classifies a region as "inside" if its winding number
   *   belongs to the chosen category (odd, nonzero, positive, negative, or
   *   absolute value of at least two).  The previous GLU tessellator (prior to
   *   GLU 1.2) used the "odd" rule.  The "nonzero" rule is another common way
   *   to define the interior.  The other three rules are useful for polygon CSG
   *   operations.
   * </LI>
   * <LI><b>GLU_TESS_BOUNDARY_ONLY</b>
   *   <BR>
   *   Is a boolean value ("value" should be set to GL_TRUE or GL_FALSE). When
   *   set to GL_TRUE, a set of closed contours separating the polygon interior
   *   and exterior are returned instead of a tessellation.  Exterior contours
   *   are oriented CCW with respect to the normal; interior contours are
   *   oriented CW. The <b>GLU_TESS_BEGIN</b> and <b>GLU_TESS_BEGIN_DATA</b>
   *   callbacks use the type GL_LINE_LOOP for each contour.
   * </LI>
   * <LI><b>GLU_TESS_TOLERANCE</b>
   *   <BR>
   *   Specifies a tolerance for merging features to reduce the size of the
   *   output. For example, two vertices that are very close to each other
   *   might be replaced by a single vertex.  The tolerance is multiplied by the
   *   largest coordinate magnitude of any input vertex; this specifies the
   *   maximum distance that any feature can move as the result of a single
   *   merge operation.  If a single feature takes part in several merge
   *   operations, the toal distance moved could be larger.
   *   <BR>
   *   Feature merging is completely optional; the tolerance is only a hint.
   *   The implementation is free to merge in some cases and not in others, or
   *   to never merge features at all.  The initial tolerance is 0.
   *   <BR>
   *   The current implementation merges vertices only if they are exactly
   *   coincident, regardless of the current tolerance.  A vertex is spliced
   *   into an edge only if the implementation is unable to distinguish which

   * <BR>
   * These callbacks are used by the tessellation object to describe how a

   * was called. The legal callbacks are as follows:
   * <UL>
   * <LI><b>GLU_TESS_BEGIN</b>
   *   <BR>
   *   The begin callback is invoked like
   *   glBegin to indicate the start of a (triangle) primitive. The method
   *   takes a single argument of type int. If the
   *   <b>GLU_TESS_BOUNDARY_ONLY</b> property is set to <b>GL_FALSE</b>, then
   *   the argument is set to either <b>GL_TRIANGLE_FAN</b>,
   *   <b>GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP</b>, or <b>GL_TRIANGLES</b>. If the
   *   <b>GLU_TESS_BOUNDARY_ONLY</b> property is set to <b>GL_TRUE</b>, then the
   *   argument will be set to <b>GL_LINE_LOOP</b>. The method prototype for
   *   this callback is:
   *   <PRE>void begin(int type);</PRE>
   * </LI>
   * <LI><b>GLU_TESS_BEGIN_DATA</b>
   *   <BR>
   *   The same as the <b>GLU_TESS_BEGIN</b> callback except
   *   that it takes an additional reference argument. This reference is
   *   identical to the opaque reference provided when
   *   {@link #gluTessBeginPolygon gluTessBeginPolygon}
   *   was called. The method prototype for this callback is:
   *   <PRE>void beginData(int type, Object polygonData);</PRE>
   * </LI>
   * <LI><b>GLU_TESS_EDGE_FLAG</b>
   *   <BR>
   *   The edge flag callback is similar to
   *   glEdgeFlag. The method takes
   *   a single boolean boundaryEdge that indicates which edges lie on the
   *   polygon boundary. If the boundaryEdge is <b>GL_TRUE</b>, then each vertex
   *   that follows begins an edge that lies on the polygon boundary, that is,
   *   an edge that separates an interior region from an exterior one. If the
   *   boundaryEdge is <b>GL_FALSE</b>, then each vertex that follows begins an
   *   edge that lies in the polygon interior. The edge flag callback (if
   *   defined) is invoked before the first vertex callback.
   *   <BR>
   *   Since triangle fans and triangle strips do not support edge flags, the
   *   begin callback is not called with <b>GL_TRIANGLE_FAN</b> or
   *   <b>GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP</b> if a non-null edge flag callback is provided.
   *   (If the callback is initialized to null, there is no impact on
   *   performance). Instead, the fans and strips are converted to independent
   *   triangles. The method prototype for this callback is:
   *   <PRE>void edgeFlag(boolean boundaryEdge);</PRE>
   * </LI>
   * <LI><b>GLU_TESS_EDGE_FLAG_DATA</b>
   *   <BR>
   *   The same as the <b>GLU_TESS_EDGE_FLAG</b> callback except that it takes
   *   an additional reference argument. This reference is identical to the
   *   opaque reference provided when
   *   {@link #gluTessBeginPolygon gluTessBeginPolygon}
   *   was called. The method prototype for this callback is:
   *   <PRE>void edgeFlagData(boolean boundaryEdge, Object polygonData);</PRE>
   * </LI>
   * <LI><b>GLU_TESS_VERTEX</b>
   *   <BR>
   *   The vertex callback is invoked between the begin and end callbacks. It is
   *   similar to glVertex3f, and it
   *   defines the vertices of the triangles created by the tessellation
   *   process. The method takes a reference as its only argument. This
   *   reference is identical to the opaque reference provided by the user when
   *   the vertex was described (see
   *   {@link #gluTessVertex gluTessVertex}). The method
   *   prototype for this callback is:
   *   <PRE>void vertex(Object vertexData);</PRE>
   * </LI>
   * <LI><b>GLU_TESS_VERTEX_DATA</b>
   *   <BR>
   *   The same as the <b>GLU_TESS_VERTEX</b> callback except that it takes an
   *   additional reference argument. This reference is identical to the opaque
   *   reference provided when
   *   {@link #gluTessBeginPolygon gluTessBeginPolygon}
   *   was called. The method prototype for this callback is:
   *   <PRE>void vertexData(Object vertexData, Object polygonData);</PRE>
   * </LI>
   * <LI><b>GLU_TESS_END</b>
   *   <BR>
   *   The end callback serves the same purpose as
   *   glEnd. It indicates the end of a
   *   primitive and it takes no arguments. The method prototype for this
   *   callback is:
   *   <PRE>void end();</PRE>
   * </LI>
   * <LI><b>GLU_TESS_END_DATA</b>
   *   <BR>
   *   The same as the <b>GLU_TESS_END</b> callback except that it takes an
   *   additional reference argument. This reference is identical to the opaque
   *   reference provided when
   *   {@link #gluTessBeginPolygon gluTessBeginPolygon}
   *   was called. The method prototype for this callback is:
   *   <PRE>void endData(Object polygonData);</PRE>
   * </LI>
   * <LI><b>GLU_TESS_COMBINE</b>
   *   <BR>
   *   The combine callback is called to create a new vertex when the
   *   tessellation detects an intersection, or wishes to merge features. The
   *   method takes four arguments: an array of three elements each of type
   *   double, an array of four references, an array of four elements each of
   *   type float, and a reference to a reference. The prototype is:
   *   <PRE>void combine(double[] coords, Object[] data,
   *                      float[] weight, Object[] outData);</PRE>
   *   The vertex is defined as a linear combination of up to four existing
   *   vertices, stored in <i>data</i>. The coefficients of the linear
   *   combination are given by <i>weight</i>; these weights always add up to 1.
   *   All vertex pointers are valid even when some of the weights are 0.
   *   <i>coords</i> gives the location of the new vertex.
   *   <BR>
   *   The user must allocate another vertex, interpolate parameters using
   *   <i>data</i> and <i>weight</i>, and return the new vertex pointer
   *   in <i>outData</i>. This handle is supplied during rendering callbacks.
   *   The user is responsible for freeing the memory some time after
   *   {@link #gluTessEndPolygon gluTessEndPolygon} is
   *   called.
   *   <BR>
   *   For example, if the polygon lies in an arbitrary plane in 3-space, and a
   *   color is associated with each vertex, the <b>GLU_TESS_COMBINE</b>
   *   callback might look like this:
   *   <PRE>
   *         void myCombine(double[] coords, Object[] data,
   *                        float[] weight, Object[] outData)
   *         {
   *            MyVertex newVertex = new MyVertex();
   *
   *            newVertex.x = coords[0];
   *            newVertex.y = coords[1];
   *            newVertex.z = coords[2];
   *            newVertex.r = weight[0]*data[0].r +
   *                          weight[1]*data[1].r +
   *                          weight[2]*data[2].r +
   *                          weight[3]*data[3].r;

   *                          weight[1]*data[1].g +
   *                          weight[2]*data[2].g +
   *                          weight[3]*data[3].g;
   *            newVertex.b = weight[0]*data[0].b +
   *                          weight[1]*data[1].b +
   *                          weight[2]*data[2].b +
   *                          weight[3]*data[3].b;
   *            newVertex.a = weight[0]*data[0].a +
   *                          weight[1]*data[1].a +

   *            outData = newVertex;
   *         }</PRE>
   *   If the tessellation detects an intersection, then the
   *   <b>GLU_TESS_COMBINE</b> or <b>GLU_TESS_COMBINE_DATA</b> callback (see
   *   below) must be defined, and it must write a non-null reference into
   *   <i>outData</i>. Otherwise the <b>GLU_TESS_NEED_COMBINE_CALLBACK</b> error
   *   occurs, and no output is generated.
   * </LI>
   * <LI><b>GLU_TESS_COMBINE_DATA</b>
   *   <BR>
   *   The same as the <b>GLU_TESS_COMBINE</b> callback except that it takes an

   *
   * </LI>
   * <LI><b>GLU_TESS_ERROR</b>
   *   <BR>
   *   The error callback is called when an error is encountered. The one
   *   argument is of type int; it indicates the specific error that occurred
   *   and will be set to one of <b>GLU_TESS_MISSING_BEGIN_POLYGON</b>,
