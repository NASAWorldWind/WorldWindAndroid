### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report to WorldWind Android. Following these guidelines helps both the
WorldWind team and community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

* Check the [**WorldWind Forum**](https://forum.worldwindcentral.com/forum/worldwind-android-wwa/android-discussion).
* Check this repository's [**issues**](https://github.com/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindAndroid/issues) to see if the problem has
already been reported. If it has and the issue is **still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening
a new one.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is similar to what you are experiencing, open a new issue
and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Submitting a Good Bug Report

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've complete the prerequisites
for submitting a bug, create an issue in the appropriate repository and providing the following information by filling out
the [template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help the WorldWind team reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear, descriptive title.**
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem.** Please be as detailed as possible. When listing steps, don't
just say what you did, but explain how you did it.
* **Provide specific examples.** Include the appropriate files, links, or code snippets which will help the WorldWind
team and community better understand the issue.
* **Describe the behavior.** Detail what behavior you observed and point out what is wrong with that behavior. Explain
which behavior you expected to see and why.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently?**
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which
conditions it normally happens.
* **Does the problem happen for all files, or only some?**
* **What is the name and version of the OS you're running?**
